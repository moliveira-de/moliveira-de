## Hey there 🙋

I'm Marco, a computer science student based in Germany.

I love building projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. 

My main tech stack is Java, Python and ASM.

I’m always curious about new technologies, experimenting with code, and turning ideas into real projects.
